Physically set platform

    Push setup button => 3 LEDs (RGR) blinks twice, Setup status indicator
      slow blink
    Check magnometer, indicate left or right via LED for user to manually
      adjust platform until oriented towards apparent magnetic North (red LEDs
      indicate direction to rotate platform base. medium speed green blink if
      within 5 degrees. solid green if within 0.5 degrees)
    Push setup button => Green LED blinks twice, indicating platform base
      oriented towards magnetic north
    Check accelerometer for level, indicate higher point(s) with leds. User
      manually adjusts legs until all 3 feet LEDs lit. (Status panel for North,
      Level, GPS fix, etc.?)
    Once oriented and level, user pushes setup button third time.

MCU setup

    Turn on GPS and acquire fix
    Compare and set real-time clock
    Compute sunrise and sunset

        if sunset > current time > sunrise
            compute current sun angle
            slew & elevate to computed position
            acquire lock using photodiode array
        else
            compute next day sunrise
            slew and elevate to computed sunrise
            system standby until 60 seconds before sunrise
            wake up
            after sunrise, acquire sun lock using photodiode array
        end if;
    
    Using magnometer and accelerometer, compute difference between computed 
      sun position and actual sun position.
    Upate offset values.


Function loop:

    if sunset > current time > sunrise
        if ambient light > threshold
            orient to sun using photodiode array
            record values (time, geoposit, sunangle, composite intensity,
              red, blue)
            delay until next measurement time (60, 30, 15 second intervals?)
        else
            compute sun angle
            orient to sun using calculated sun angle
            record values
            delay until next measurement time
        end if;
    else
        compute next sunrise
        orient to computed sunrise sun angle
        set modules to stanby
        delay until sunrise
        wake modules
        ensure GPS fix, north orientation, and level
        verify clocks
    end if;

end loop;
