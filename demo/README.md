# Demo
Copyright Â© 2016 Eric Laursen

This portion of the project is where I'm learning to cross compile and use the
various features of the STM32F407 Discovery microcontroller.

To date:

   Successfully interfaced to an Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout v3 via USART2
   Successfully interfaced to a Pololu DRV8834 Low-Voltage Stepper Motor Driver
     Carrier

Many things left to learn to do before the project can actually be realized...
I2C, SPI, design and print the mechanical parts, etc.
