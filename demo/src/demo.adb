-- Purpose:
--   The file declares the main procedure for the demonstration. It is based on
--   code found in Jim Caillard's "ada-2hu" repository at
--   https://github/yaon/ada-2hu
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

with Driver;               pragma Unreferenced (Driver);
--  The Driver package contains the task that actually controls the app so
--  although it is not referenced directly in the main procedure, we need it
--  in the closure of the context clauses so that it will be included in the
--  executable.

with Motor;                pragma Unreferenced (Motor);

with Last_Chance_Handler;  pragma Unreferenced (Last_Chance_Handler);
--  The "last chance handler" is the user-defined routine that is called when
--  an exception is propagated. We need it in the executable, therefore it
--  must be somewhere in the closure of the context clauses.

with System;

procedure Demo is
   pragma Priority (System.Priority'First);
begin
   loop
      null;
   end loop;
end Demo;
